# Create a simple YAML document with two mappings. 
# The first mapping should map the key human to the value trainer. 
# The second mapping should map the key animals to a value that contains two nested mappings:
# the first which maps the key elephant to the value circus
# the second which maps the key horse to the value rodeo
# Remember to end each mapping with a line break and indent your nested mappings 
# by the same number of spaces!

human: trainer
animals:
  elephant: circus
